// Async/Await = Async = makes a function return a promise
//                            Await = makes an async function wait for a promise

// Allows you write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner
// Async doesn't have resolve or reject set up as parameters
// Everything after Await is placed in an event queue
// A function can be declared as async 
// meaning you put async before the word function 
// for example:
// function (variable_name) (){} > async function (variable_name) (){}

// promise code

// from line 66-73
// as you can see the walkDog > cleanKitchen > takeOutTrash have been codded/written in a synchronous manner

// if you ever attempt to use await without the async > you will get uncaught syntax error 

// you usually put try block then catch errors which is usually term as "try catch" error handling
